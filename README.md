# composite-resize

A GUI app to adjust the width of a composite without having to resize it.

You will need Python 3, tkinter (included with Windows Python installations), and pillow.

There may be an issue that causes the window to be created without a frame. It will still work.

When you save the image, you must specify an extension.
